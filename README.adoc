= EclipseLink ClassCast showcase

This project demonstrates via an eclipselink ClassCastException.

Demo 1:
Junit Unit test using EclipseLink and h2.

Demo 2:
Junit Integration test case using OpenLiberty.

== Executing the tests

`mvn clean verify`

As maven will stop after the first test failure, the integration test is not being executed.

To execute both tests, run:

`mvn clean verify -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true`

== Unit test

The unit test takes the existing persistence.xml and overrides some values via a property map.
The jdbc url is set to a h2 memory db.

The test executed is a simple `select case â€¦ then true else false` JPQL statement.

=== Dependencies

The following dependencies were added:

* *eclipselink* +
used as an JPA implementation, which is also used by OpenLiberty.

== Integration test

The integration test uses the integration test lifecycle of the openliberty maven plugin.

All *IT classes are automatically executed in this phase only.

=== Dependencies

The following dependencies were added:

* *jersey* +
A jax-rs client implementation, used to connect to the OpenLiberty instance
* *hk2* +
Jersey requires the hk2 DI library on the classpath but has no dependency on it.
